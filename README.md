# Multi-layer-perceptron-MLP-regressor-and-hyperparameter-tuning
This study explains some terms in machine learning - Neural Network and then focuses on modeling a noisy sine wave using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) regressor. Hyperparameter tuning was performed using grid search to determine the optimal neural network architecture.
